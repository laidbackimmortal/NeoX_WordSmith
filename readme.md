# WordSmith - Decentralized Blockchain Word Game

WordSmith is a decentralized blockchain-powered word-guessing game where players use **TheMythicToken ($TMT$)** to guess mystery words. Only vowels are initially visible, and players must deduce the word within five attempts. Correct guesses reward players with tokens, while wrong guesses add to the challenge. Built on blockchain technology, WordSmith ensures transparency, fairness, and secure token management.
